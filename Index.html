                <br>
                I worked as a technical support agent for Microsoft products. Took calls
                and chats regarding the Office suite programs and also assisted people in
                Windows related issues. Helped deal with frustrated customers and
                provide solutions to their issues in a fast and efficient manner.

                <br>
                I worked part time at Lee Lee International Supermarkets. I was in charge
                of data entry and also responsible for general customer support. While
                being given the task of inputting data into the systems which resulted in
                price updates and new products being able to be scanned by the cash
                registers. I also changed shelf labels to correspond to changes in price.
                While doing all of this I was also there to provide any and all types of help
                to the customers.
